# Machine-Health-Prognostics
The problem addressed by predictive health monitoring and machine prognosis is the inefficiency and risks associated with reactive health and machine maintenance management. Traditional methods often wait until symptoms or failures occur before taking action, leading to higher costs, increased downtime, and potential health complications or machine breakdowns. This reactive approach needs to have foresight and prevent issues before they escalate.

Predictive health monitoring and machine prognosis aim to shift towards a proactive approach by leveraging data analytics and machine learning to anticipate potential problems, enabling early intervention, preventive measures, and optimized resource allocation. This proactive strategy helps mitigate risks, reduce costs, improve efficiency, and improve health outcomes or machine performance.
In our approach, we used an ensemble model using the NASA Bearing Dataset. Also, we used a Gaussian Process regression on the same dataset from which we got the following results.
